# React Authentication and Security README

This README provides an overview of the authentication flow and security measures implemented in this React application for user registration and login.

## Authentication Flow

### Registration (Signup)

1. Users enter their desired username and password.
2. The application sends a POST request to the server with the username and password in JSON format.
3. The server checks if the username is available and stores the user's credentials securely, usually by hashing and salting the password.
4. If registration is successful, the server sends a response with a success message, such as `{ "message": "Successful" }`, and a status code of 200.
5. If registration fails (e.g., due to a duplicate username or other validation errors), the server sends an error response with an error message, such as `{ "error": "Username already exists" }`, and a status code other than 200.

### Login

1. Users enter their registered username and password.
2. The application sends a POST request to the server with the username and password in JSON format.
3. The server compares the provided password with the stored for the corresponding username.
4. If login fails (e.g., due to incorrect credentials), the server sends an error response, and the client displays an error message to the user.
